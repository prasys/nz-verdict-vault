      "summary": "The Tribunal ruled on the case of DIJ v New Zealand Police, addressing the plaintiff's request for access to personal information held by the Police under the Privacy Act 2020. The Police had previously investigated the plaintiff's allegations of unlawful sexual violation and indecent assault but did not lay charges. The plaintiff sought access to their personal information, including a transcript of the accused's police interview, which the Police refused to release, citing privacy concerns for the accused. The Tribunal found that the Police had interfered with the plaintiff's privacy by not providing access to the requested documents and ordered the Police to release a redacted version of the transcript and other documents. The Tribunal also awarded damages for humiliation and injury to feelings, as well as legal costs incurred by the plaintiff.",
